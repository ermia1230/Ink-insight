User Consultation and Feedback 1 - InkInsight App Prototype Stage
Introduction:
During the prototyping phase of our InkInsight App, we conducted a consultation session with a user to gather feedback 
and insights to enhance the app's functionalities and user experience.

Key Findings

1. Review System
User Feedback: The user expressed a desire to view and provide feedback for the books they explore within the app.
Solution: To address this, we decided to implement a 1-5 stars rating system with review functionality, enabling users to set their ratings and reviews for each book. 
Additionally, users can view the average rating of a book based on the collective ratings provided by other users.

2. Intuitive Exploration
User Feedback: The user found the app's navigation intuitive and easily understandable, allowing them to explore the app's features and understand its purpose 
without requiring much guidance.
Goals: We aim to maintain this intuitive design throughout the app, ensuring users can easily navigate and utilize its features effortlessly. We have decided to implement a sidebar to make exploration even more intuitive. 

3. Customizable Lists
User Feedback: The user appreciated the customizable lists feature within our app, recognizing its value and potential for the target audience.
Our original prototype only gave users the option to add book to lists in the bookDetails page. However, the user suggested that for efficiency,
this feature should be implemented in the search page as well under each book. 

Improvements: We plan to further refine and enhance the customizable lists functionality, allowing users to create, manage, and organize lists 
tailored to their reading preferences more effectively. We will add the add to list page feature in the search page as the user suggested.

Action Plan
Implement Rating System: Complete the implementation of the 1-5 stars rating system to allow users to rate books and view average ratings. Additionally, implement a review system in which users can also leave comments under each book.
Streamline Navigation: Ensure a seamless and intuitive navigation experience for users to explore various functionalities effortlessly. Implement a sidebar and a settings tab to ensure this. 
Enhance Customizable Lists: Refine the customizable lists feature, incorporating user feedback to improve its usability and utility for readers.
